## Overview
Record linkage is becoming increasingly important in statistical and academic research. This technique seek to find links from multiple files that can increase the efficiency of data collection and enrich information by linking with another sources. In this project, 

* Using blocking algorithm to improve the computational time.
* Using machine learning model as baseline models to detect records.
* Using deep learning architecture to outperform the result.

## Background
Entity resolution is a information integration problem caused by identifying and linking different information sources. It is known as record linkage and deduplication [Li & G 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/book/9780124047020/intelligent-systems-for-security-informatics). The record linkage is a procedure to find links from multiple files that represent the same entity or identify in a single dataset [Yancey 2004](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Improving-EM-Algorithm-Estimates-for-Record-Linkage-Yancey/0143d09b47cc852df754ae4098723ba88d0293d0). In computer science, record linkage is also known as data matching and this technique is becoming more and more common in statistical and academic research such as E-Commerce, health research and crime detection. 

Motivated by this, we want to build a link between Google and Amazon products datasets that compare shopping platforms to link products from multiple online shops. It can allow customers to see all offers from same products across different online shops. We use binary classifier to classify record pairs into matches and nonmatches, explore different methods to classify candidate record pairs and find a suitable model for datasets.
